# syfo-oppfolgingsplan-frontend

## Getting Started

Run the development server with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to for example [http://localhost:3000/syk/oppfolgingsplan/123](http://localhost:3000/syk/oppfolgingsplan/123) to test the app.

## Testing

The project uses Vitest for unit and component testing.

Run ```npm run test``` to run Vitest, which will find all unit test files in the project and run the tests. You can have it running in the terminal while editing code, and the affected tests will automatically rerun when saving files.

For VS Code the [Vitest extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vitest.explorer) is nice.

See more documentation in `Testing.md`.
